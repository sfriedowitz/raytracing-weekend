# Ray Tracing in One Weekend: Rust Edition

The miniseries [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/),
implemented in the Rust programming language.

The series consists of three parts:

1) [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)
2) [Ray Tracing: The Next Week](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingTheNextWeek.html)
3) [Ray Tracing: The Rest of Your Life](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingTheRestOfYourLife.html)

The implementation follows almost exactly as described in the book series,
with some small twists for personal preference and optimization.
